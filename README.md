## Hey, welcome to my profile!
My name is Trey, I go by "Dodge Viper" on Discord, I'm a Trial Moderator for Contractors Showdown: Exfilzone (my favorite game) and here are my favorite quotes:

---

"I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers- because you did, too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way across the world. The most important thing in life, will always be the people in this room. Salute mi familia. You'll always be with me... And you'll always be my brother." - Dominic Toretto, Furious 7
